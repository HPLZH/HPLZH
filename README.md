## My projects

### BlackWhite (黑白)

A small game.

My friend LJH gave me the idea of making the game.

The latest version is 2.4.16. It can run on Android, Windows 10 and Windows 11 without Internet.

This project is paused and it will continue later.

### FiveSonChess (五子棋)

One of my friend (maybe CLK) "invented" this Chinglish translation.

I made the game with VisualBasic 6.0 in 2019. (maybe 2018 or 2020)

It was not good enough, and I lost its source code. So, I want to make a new one.

This project hasn't been started so far.

### Electric Net (电网)

My friend LKX gave me the rule of this game and he made the Java edition of this game.

I want to make the .NET edition (including server and client).
